# 09. Input and Output

## Hello, World!

- compile program (to executable) with `ghc <path-to/source-file>`
- when execute a program via terminal, `IO` with the name `main` will be run
- compile and run program in one command by `runhaskell <path-to/source-file>`
- intuition `>>=`: next computation relies on the result of the previous
- intuition `>>`: next computation ignores the result of the previous (but not its side-effect)
- `IO` separates pure/impure part of the code because calling impure (`IO`) functions like `getLine` does not guarantee to return the same result when calling it the next time
- `IO` will only be performed if it eventually falls into `main`
  - or running the `IO` action in `ghci`
  ```
  # in ghci
  > :l src/09-input-and-output.hs
  > greeting
  ```
- `return` makes an IO action from a pure value (lifting the value to IO)

## Useful IO functions

- `putStr`
- `putChar`
- `print` (like `putStrLn . show`)
- `getChar`
- `when` takes a boolean and an IO action - "run" it if the boolean is `True`
- `sequence` performs multiple IO actions and binds their results in a list
  - `sequence :: [IO a] -> IO [a]`
- `mapM` sequence map combined
- `mapM_` like `mapM` but throws away the result
- `forever` takes an IO action and repeats it forever
- `forM` 

## Files and streams

- `getContents` reads from stdin until encounters an EOF character (Ctrl-D)
  - it's lazy like everything else in Haskell
  - it won't read the entire content but rather process it like stream
  - so you can use unix `cat` to pipe text to the program
  - e.g. `cat haiku.txt | ./capslocker`
- `interact` the pattern of taking IO input, transform, then output (IO)
  - takes the transform function of type `String -> String`
- reading/writing from stdin/stdout (terminal) is similar to r/w to a special type of file.
- `openFile` takes `FilePath` and `IOMode` returning `IO Handle` (file handler)
  - `FilePath` is just an alias for `String`
  - `data IOMode = ReadMode | WriteMode | AppendMode | ReadWriteMode`
  - think of `Handle` as the reference to the file
- `withFile` is similar to `openFile` but will close the file automatically once the `IO` action "returns"
- `hGetLine`, `hPutStr`, `hPutStrLn`, `hGetChar` all takes a handler and work like the non-"h" counterparts
  - the `h` versions (e.g. `hGetContents`) takes file `handle`
  - `hGetContents :: Handle -> IO String`
  - `getContents :: IO String`
  - think of the "default" `putStr` has stdout handle already applied - i.e. `putStr == hPutStr stdout`

> when seeing an IO action think "will" (promise) - an instruction (data) that something will happens, hence you can compose them together - OR think of it like connecting pipes of data streams
> example: `putStr` "will" write the content (streamed) to stdout / `getLine` "will" read a line from stdin

- common file handling helpers: `readFile`, `writeFile`, `appendFile`
  - similir to `withFile` the runtime will handle the closing of the file automatically
- for text files, the default buffering is usually line-buffering
- for binary files, the default buffering is usually block-buffering (chunk, determine by the operating system)
- `hSetBuffering handle` can be set to override the default buffering
  - `NoBuffering` means it will read one character at a time (bad idea, spam disk access)

## Command line arguments

> run `stack ghc <program.hs>` to compile the program
> run `stack runhaskell <program.hs>` to compile and run the program

- use `getArgs` (`System.Environment`) to get command line arguments (strings)
- use `getProgName` to get program name

## Randomness

- calling the random function twice with the random value generator produces the same "random" value
- `random` takes a generator and produce a random value with a new generator
- `randoms` takes a initial generator and produces an infinite list of random values
- `randomR` takes a generator and produces a value in a range. The result in inclusive of lower and upper bound.
- `getStdGen` get `IO StdGen` for real randomness.
  - note that when the program starts, it askes the system to get a random number generator and store it in the global generator.
  - `getStdGen` returns the global generatorâ€”i.e. calling it twice will give the same generator and will result in the same random values.
  - to get different result, you have to generate infinite stream and take different parts of the stream (e.g. use `splitAt`)
  - or use `newStdGen`
- `newStdGen` will create a new global generator. Calling `getStdGen` afterward will also return the new global generator (which is different that the one before calling `newStdGen`).

## ByteString

> Whenever you need better performance in a program that reads a lot of data into strings, give bytestrings a try. Start with normal string and convert to bytestring if the performance is not good enough.

- reading string (lazy) as a stream has overhead of processing each character individually
- Bytestring handles them in chunks (64k - fits neatly into CPU's L2 cache)
- `pack` turns `[Word8]` to `ByteString`. `Word8` is an integer between 0-255 represents an 8-bit number.
- `fromChunks`, `toChunks` convert between strict and lazy bytestrings
  - `fromChunks` is good to "join" small strict bytestrings into chunks of lazy ones to process them more efficiently
- `cons` (like list `:` cons) prepend a byte into the front of bytestring
  - not very efficient because it'll create a new chunk (thunk of chunk) even it's not full (64k)
  - better to use the strict `cons'` if going to insert bytes into the front of bytestrings
- there're also functions similar to those from `System.IO` but operates on `ByteString` instead - e.g. `readFile`

## Exceptions

> Pure functions are lazy by default, which means that we don't know when they will be evaluated (order of execution) and that it really shouldn't matter. However, once pure functions start throwing exceptions, it matters when they are evaluated.

- When dealing with pure functions, (ideally) only think about what a function returns
- Don't mix exceptions and pure code.
- Model pure functions without exceptions and use exceptions only in I/O parts
- `System.Directory (doesFileExist)` gives `IO Bool` to check if the file exists 
- `System.IO.Error (catchIOError)` can be used to to try-catch
  - `ioError` is used to rethrow error (taking `IOError`) and produces IO action that will throw the error
- `isAlreadyExistsError`, `isDoesNotExistError`, `isAlreadyInUseError`, `isFullError`, `isEOFError`, `isIllegalOperation`, `isPermissionError`, `isUserError`
- `System.IO.Error` contains functions (starts with `ioe`, e.g. `ioeGetFileName`) to get attributes from the exceptions
